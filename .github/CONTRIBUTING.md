## What to contribute?

Contributions come in many forms, some examples include:

* Writing Documentation

### Propose documentation changes

Osmo Docs requires everyone, without exception, to submit doc-change proposals by using a pull request (PR). PRs enable contributions from the community, easy testing, and straightforward peer review.

To contribute a doc-change proposal, use the following workflow:

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis).
2. [Add an upstream](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) so that you can update your fork.
3. Clone your fork to your computer.
4. Create a branch and name it appropriately.
5. Work on only one change in one pull request.
6. Follow these conventions:

    1. Make your changes adhering to the [Osmosis Docs Style Guide](STYLE-GUIDE.md) and the coding conventions described below. Generally, a commit serves a single purpose and differences should be easy to understand. Do not mix formatting fixes or code moves with actual code changes.
    2. Commit your changes. Write a simple, straightforward commit message. To learn more, see [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
    3. Push your changes to your remote fork.
    4. Create a PR on the Osmo Docs repository.
    5. Identify the type of PR by adding labels to it. For example, if you're still working on the changes, add the **work-in-progress** label. If you are proposing an enhancement, add the **enhancement** label.
    6. Wait for your changes to be reviewed. If you are a maintainer, you can assign your PR to one or more reviewers. If you aren't a maintainer, one of the maintainers will assign a reviewer.
    7. After you receive feedback from a reviewer, make the requested changes, commit them to your branch, and push them to your remote fork again.

After your PR is approved and validated, and no conflicts exist, it will be merged by a maintainer. -->
